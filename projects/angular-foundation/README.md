# Angular Foundation

A basic Angular component library created with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli).

Please note, this project is an excercise in creating an angular component library. _It is not full-featured_ (or very featured at all).
If you're looking for a real component library built on Zurb Foundation, check out [ngx-foundation](https://www.ngxfoundation.com/).
